# TECHNOLOGY BUSINESS MANAGEMENT

Technology Business Management (TBM) is a framework and methodology that helps organizations manage and optimize their technology investments. TBM provides a structured approach to understanding, managing, and communicating the cost, consumption, and value of technology within an organization. It bridges the gap between IT and business by offering transparency into IT spending and aligning it with business goals.

## Key Components of TBM:
1. Cost Transparency: TBM provides detailed visibility into where and how money is being spent on technology. This includes understanding the costs of hardware, software, services, labor, and other IT resources.

2. Value Management: TBM helps organizations assess the value derived from their IT investments. This involves evaluating the business outcomes that result from technology spending and ensuring that investments are aligned with strategic goals.

3. Service-Based Costing: TBM uses a service-based approach to allocate costs. Instead of just categorizing expenses by department, TBM breaks down costs by services provided (e.g., email services, cloud computing, data storage), giving a clearer picture of how IT resources are being used.

4. Decision-Making Support: By providing a clear understanding of IT costs and their impact on the business, TBM supports better decision-making. It enables IT leaders to make informed choices about where to invest, cut costs, or reallocate resources.

5. Benchmarking: TBM allows organizations to benchmark their IT spending and performance against industry standards or peers. This helps identify areas where efficiency can be improved or where additional investment may be needed.

6. Agility and Flexibility: TBM helps organizations adapt to changing business needs by providing real-time insights into IT spending and resource allocation. This allows for more agile responses to market changes, customer demands, or internal shifts.

## Why TBM is Important:
Alignment of IT and Business: TBM ensures that IT investments are directly aligned with business priorities, leading to better overall performance and outcomes.
Cost Efficiency: By understanding where money is being spent and what value is being derived, organizations can optimize their technology budgets and reduce waste.
Strategic Planning: TBM supports long-term planning by providing a clear view of the IT landscape, helping organizations prepare for future challenges and opportunities.
TBM Council:
The TBM Council is a nonprofit organization that promotes the adoption and development of TBM practices. It offers resources, best practices, and a community for IT and finance professionals interested in TBM. The council also developed the TBM framework, which many organizations use as a standard approach to managing technology costs and investments.

Overall, TBM is a vital tool for modern organizations that want to ensure their technology investments are delivering maximum value and are aligned with their strategic goals.
